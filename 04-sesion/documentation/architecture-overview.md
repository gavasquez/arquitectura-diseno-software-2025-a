## 🎯 Design Decisions

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
**Decision**: Adopt DDD principles for complex business logic
**Rationale**: 
- Clear separation of business concerns
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Better alignment with business requirements
- Facilitates team collaboration

**Implementation**:
- Bounded contexts for each domain (Product, User, Order, Financial)
- Rich domain models with business logic encapsulation
- Domain services for complex business operations

### 2. Clean Architecture
**Decision**: Implement Clean Architecture for dependency management
**Rationale**:
- Independence of frameworks and external concerns
- Testability and maintainability
- Clear dependency flow from outer layers to inner layers
- Technology agnostic core business logic

**Implementation**:
- Domain layer (innermost) with no external dependencies
- Application layer with use cases and application services
- Infrastructure layer for external concerns
- Interface layer for user interaction

### 3. Microservices Architecture
**Decision**: Start with modular monolith, evolve to microservices
**Rationale**:
- Reduced initial complexity and operational overhead
- Easier development and debugging
- Gradual evolution based on business needs
- Team autonomy and technology diversity

**Implementation**:
- Clear service boundaries aligned with domain contexts
- API Gateway for external communication
- Service mesh for internal communication
- Shared database initially, evolve to database per service

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
**Decision**: Implement event-driven patterns for loose coupling
**Rationale**:
- Decoupled service communication
- Improved scalability and resilience
- Better handling of asynchronous operations
- Audit trail and business process tracking

**Implementation**:
- Domain events for business state changes
- Event sourcing for critical business processes
- Message queues for reliable event delivery
- Event store for audit and replay capabilities
